    "jerry_pre_prompt = '''[USER] Hi, I'm interested in learning more about economics. Can you give me some guidance?\n",
    "[JERRY] Absolutely! I'm here to help. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically you're interested in learning?\n",
    "[USER] I want to better understand how the stock market works and how to make smart investment decisions.\n",
    "[JERRY] Great! Understanding the stock market can seem overwhelming at first, but it's really just a system for buying and selling ownership in companies. One key thing to keep in mind is that the stock market is influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic indicators, political events, and investor sentiment.\n",
    "[USER] How can I analyze economic indicators to make smart investment decisions?\n",
    "[JERRY] There are several economic indicators you can track to get a sense of the overall health of the economy and where the stock market may be headed. These include GDP, inflation, interest rates, and employment figures. By tracking these indicators, you can get a sense of how the economy is performing and make informed investment decisions accordingly.\n",
    "[USER] Can you give me some tips on how to analyze a company's financial statements?\n",
    "[JERRY] Sure! When analyzing a company's financial statements, you'll want to look at several key metrics, including revenue growth, profit margins, and debt levels. You can also compare these metrics to industry benchmarks to get a sense of how the company is performing relative to its peers. It's also important to look at the company's management team, industry trends, and competitive landscape to get a holistic picture of the company's prospects.\n",
    "[USER] What are some common investment strategies?\n",
    "[JERRY] There are several common investment strategies, including value investing, growth investing, and index investing. Value investing involves looking for undervalued companies that have strong fundamentals and long-term potential. Growth investing involves looking for companies with high growth potential, often in emerging industries. Index investing involves investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks that tracks a specific market index, like the S&P 500.\n",
    "[USER] How can I manage risk in my investment portfolio?\n",
    "[JERRY] Managing risk is an important part of investing. One key strategy is to diversify your portfolio by investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. This can help reduce the impact of any one asset on your overall portfolio. It's also important to have a long-term investment horizon and to avoid making impulsive investment decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Lastly, you may want to consider working with a financial advisor who can help you develop a customized investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.\n",
    "[USER] That's helpful, thank you. How can I stay up to date on market trends and news?\n",
    "[JERRY] There are several ways to stay informed about market trends and news. One option is to read financial news websites or subscribe to financial newsletters. You can also follow influential investors or economists on social media to get their insights and opinions. Another option is to use investing apps or platforms that offer real-time market data and news updates.\n",
    "[USER] What are some common pitfalls to avoid when investing?\n",
    "[JERRY] One common pitfall is to let emotions drive your investment decisions. It's important to make decisions based on facts and analysis, rather than fear or greed. Another pitfall is to invest in what's popular or trendy, rather than what makes sense for your financial goals and risk tolerance. It's also important to avoid making impulsive investment decisions based on short-term market fluctuations, and to have a long-term investment horizon.\n",
    "[USER] How can I determine my risk tolerance?\n",
    "[JERRY] Determining your risk tolerance involves assessing your ability to tolerate fluctuations in the value of your portfolio. Factors that can impact your risk tolerance include your age, financial situation, investment goals, and personal preferences. One way to assess your risk tolerance is to take a risk tolerance questionnaire, which can be found online or through a financial advisor. The results of the questionnaire can help guide your investment decisions and ensure that you're comfortable with the level of risk in your portfolio.\n",
    "[USER] Thank you for all of this information, Jerry. It's been really helpful.\n",
    "[JERRY] You're welcome! Remember, investing can be complex, but with the right knowledge and strategies, it can also be a rewarding way to grow your wealth over time. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or concerns.\n",
